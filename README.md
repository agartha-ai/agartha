# Agartha model for the earth's crust

this is the model for the earth's crust.

The goal of this space is to explore and discuss ways to build modern machine learning tools for this data set. Basically I want to build an embeddings type model for the earth’s crust above the Moho. So that people could use the model embeddings to make predictions about the earth’s crust in a particular area.

plan:

So, in summary:
	•	Stage 1: Pre-train an embedding model on the global grids using masked feature prediction (modeled after BEiT’s philosophy).
	•	Stage 2: Fine-tune or adapt the model on LILY site data to make embeddings that are both globally applicable and anchored to ground truth
